        <p class="w3-text-grey" style="font-size: medium; margin-top: 40px;">During the last semester of the third year, I worked on the <strong>biggest project</strong> of my school career. For this project, all specialty areas were teamed up. For example, I sat with Britt De Keyser and Zeno Loyen from Artificial Intelligence, Wout Hebberecht and Jonax Dox from Cloud & Cyber Security and with Ischa Mommaerts from Application Development. This project ran <strong>from October 2023</strong> to February 2023. During the <strong>first phase</strong>, in October, we worked on <strong>project management</strong> and preparing a <strong>project plan</strong>. During the next phase, which ran from November to December, we were working on the <strong>concept phase</strong>, mainly research oriented, and from January to February we were fully engaged in the <strong>realization of this project</strong>.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey" style="font-size: medium; margin-top: 40px;">This assignment was offered by <strong>Mediaan</strong>, Mediaan is an organization that creates custom software applications from A to Z, focusing on technologies such as NET Stack, React, Computer Vision, Azure, etc.
            This client was looking for a solution to <strong>improve security</strong> at crowded places/events using AI. In other words, <strong>creating a Crowd Monitoring system</strong>. When you think of Crowd Monitoring, you probably think of <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, but this way still came with too many <strong>limitations</strong>. For example, you only have a limited view and people could potentially walk out of the cameras' field of view. Also because of the constant movement of objects and people, this was not the ideal solution. 
            Hence, Mediaan was looking for a better solution and entrusted that task to us. So the purpose of this assignment was to <strong>improve event security using Aritificial Intelligence</strong>. In doing so, it had to be possible to detect certain events and moods. One had to have clear and quick insight into this collected information and there also had to be dispatch capabilities so that timely intervention could be made if necessary. So this solution was not to be based entirely on Computer Vision.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey" style="font-size: medium; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">But what exactly did I do in this assignment? I worked with the other developper to create a <strong>web application</strong> where all the different users can <strong>log in</strong>, each with <strong>their function</strong>. Based on this function, they were also each personally assigned their own layout. For example, there were <strong>3 functions: admin, aeamlead & agent</strong>. So an admin can manage just about everything, he can <strong>create and manage events</strong>, here he can also <strong>add users</strong>, which he himself can edit in a separate tab, also he can <strong>add devices</strong> to this (microphones), and also he can add the specific information to the event. He also has a nice overview of all events that are active or to come. He can also <strong>send messages</strong> that the team leads and agents see in their designated message section. Then a team lead can view his events to which he is assigned, with all the information required as well. He also has another separate tab where he can <strong>view the incoming data</strong>, this includes the moods and events coming in through the API. The agents can only see the events to which he is assigned.</p>
